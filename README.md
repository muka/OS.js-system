# OS.js System Packages

## About this fork

This fork implements various Linux (& Mac?) DBus APIs to gain control of the underlaying system from OS.js

Currently available:

* Retrieve data from org.freedesktop.NetworkManager

TODO:

* Listen for updates (eg PropertyChanged)
* Allow to interact and configure settings from OS.js

Help is welcome, even more if on the OS.js side :)

**IN DEVELOPMENT, DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING TO WORK**


This repository contains System packages for [OS.js](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js).

Follow [the official instructions](https://os.js.org/doc/manuals/man-package-manager.html) on how to add this repository.
